      <description>Creating a container using Containerd ¶ The code below is an example of creating a container using Containerd. First, connect to Containerd using the UNIX domain socket containerd.sock. Containerd is a daemon process that always runs in the background. After that, through the Client object, Containerd gets the latest Debian Linux image and creates a Debian container. Very intuitive and simple, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? What you can see here is that it communicates with the process through the Client object.</description>

What do you think of the sentence? I was just curious about the technology implemented by containers, but didn&amp;rsquo;t think much of it because I didn&amp;rsquo;t make a living using the related technology. However, I recently found out that it was a very big topic in the related industry.</description>
