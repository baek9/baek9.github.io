      <description>#Intel #EdisonBoard
Intel Edison boards are now discontinued. The successor, the Joule board, was also discontinued. As both products were made for the Internet of things (IoT), there are many opinions that Intel is withdrawing from this market. Anyway, Intel has extremely miniaturized the Edison board to meet IoT and wearables. Although it is a board that is no longer supported, it is smaller than the Raspberry Pi (RPi), but I tried it because I was attracted to the performance that was not lacking.</description>
