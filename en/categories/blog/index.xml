      <description>In the previous part, we looked at how to create a blog and apply a theme using Hugo. In this part, I summarized the results of thinking about how to efficiently manage source code with a function called Submodule, assuming that GitHub is being used.
Source code structure built with Hugo ¶ If you had previously built your blog with Hugo, the directory structure below would have been created. Rather than explaining everything, let&amp;rsquo;s look at a few necessary folders.</description>

      <description>Usually, when looking at how to build a blog using Jekyll or Hugo, config.yml or config.toml will be explained. Jekyll even mentions how to use ruby on the official website, so it&amp;rsquo;s a situation where the belly button is bigger than the belly button. config.toml is an important and essential file that contains various settings related to the blog, but I have not seen a single line of documentation explaining config.</description>

      <description>Return to previous blog ¶ In the first part, I said that I had been running an old blog hosted by a famous tool called Jekyll and GitHub Pages for a long time, but I moved to Google&amp;rsquo;s Blogger for various reasons. However, I decided to continue using the existing blog. There were several reasons for this.

      <description>The previously used Jekyll was implemented in Ruby, a rather unfamiliar language, so I personally had difficulties in installation, customization, and maintenance. So I started looking for a blog platform where I could focus on writing, and although there were many good services, I chose a traditional blogger. In fact, I made a new blog using a blogger, but I gave up right away and decided to use the Static Site Generator (SSG) again to revive the existing blog.</description>

      <description>Static Site Generator (SSG) ¶ There was a time when a static site generator (SSG) was in the spotlight with the advent of a tool called Jekyll. I also built a blog a long time ago using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. The static site generator has the advantage of creating a great site without having to build or know the backend solutions necessary for rendering web pages, including databases. The resulting static site is implemented only with HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheet), and JavaScript, and operates only with a browser.</description>
