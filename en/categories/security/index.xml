      <description>#HTTPS #SSL #PKI
One of the things I learned from the Chromium analysis is that more JavaScript methods can be used in web pages accessed via https than http. That is, Chrome grants differentiated rights to web pages according to the scheme. ”http://“, ”https://“, “chrome://“ more powerful? method can be called. The chrome scheme is, of course, different from other schemes in terms of functionality and security because it deals with parts related to the operation of Chrome like the settings page of Chrome (chrome://settings)&amp;hellip; Others were quite surprised.</description>
