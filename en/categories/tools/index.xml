      <description>#VSCode
During kernel development, the process from build to test to debugging is quite cumbersome. For this reason, we saw that QEMU and gdb were linked to build a development environment. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s comparable to that, but there were some difficulties in development related to the Linux graphics stack. It was only later that I realized it was good for my mental health that it was better to set up a development environment in the first place, even if it bothered me.</description>
